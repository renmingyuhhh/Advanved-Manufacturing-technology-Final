For a comprehensive product plan, I design the basic functional modules of the product in SW. 

Due to considerations such as time and modeling accuracy, the model did not include parts such as the charging post, camera 
and display that should be included in the product, and there were gaps in the details of the electronic components.

The Model folder contains all the model files, and the Infor folder contains detailed information about the standard parts used in the product 
and the vendors from which they can be purchased. A borrowed finished model (STM32F103C8T6) is also included.

The general design and details of the product can be viewed in the plans.
